Notes on the expenses app --

Basically 3 sections :

1 -- Friends (to view / add new friends)
2 -- Expenses (to view / add new expenses b/w friends)
3 -- Summary (displays all expenses chrnologically)

Finished up the friends and expenses tab but unable to get the summary tab to work. Thinking I should use the SummaryController to get data from the expenses model and display it on the summary tab. Tried it, but that doesn't seem to be working. I'm missing something here.


For summarizing name wise, use the aggreagated @each property.
