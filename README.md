Bounty-Web-Expenses
===================

Tracking expenses accurately can be a real headache for roommates / co-workers - especially if you have a "kanjoos". Today there are quite a few apps (mobile or web) that allow you to do this, but we want to see your take on this problem.

Your task is to build a simple (yet functional) Expense Manager app using Ember.js. Remember we are going to evaluate you on the following parameters:
 * How you think and how creative you are
 * How you code - structure, comments, and efficiency
 * And how quickly can you learn

Few screens can be
- Add New Member
- Add New Expense
- Summary Sheet

If you are going for the kill and you really want to wow us:

1.  Data Visualization
2.  Options like Print, Export to xls etc 
3.  Server Side Synchronization

### Starting with Ember
* http://emberjs.com - Its the official website of Ember. Good guides and API docs
* http://ember-cli.com - Its a simple tool / project structure that helps you get started with ember very quickly. Definitely use this and build the project with it
* [Ember CLI + Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs3Fdup7aUo) - a 9 min video where you'll learn how to build a chat application that uses Ember and Firebase to persist data.
* https://github.com/foraker/ember-reading-group - a good set of links that helps you learn Ember the pro-way.

### Final Words
When you are done, please just create a pull request on this repo. We would like you to come in and present your code to the whole team. 

May the force be with you!
