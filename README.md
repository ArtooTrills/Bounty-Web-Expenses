Bounty-Web-Expenses
===================

Tracking expenses accurately can be a real headache for roommates / co-workers - especially if you have a "kanjoos". Today there are quite a few apps (mobile or web) that allow you to do this, but we want to see your take on this problem.

Your task is to build a simple (yet functional) Expense Manager app using Ember.js. Remember we are going to evaluate you on the following parameters:
 * How you think and how creative you are
 * How you code - structure, comments, and efficiency
 * And how quickly can you learn

We have included a few graphics to get you started below. Be creative in your approach.
